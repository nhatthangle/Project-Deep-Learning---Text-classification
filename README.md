# Deep Learning Project - Text classification
By Nhat Thang LE & Emir Dakin TARIK

## Motivation and objectives: 

In recent years, text classification has become a well-known topic around the world with a wide range of applications in dectecting hateful racisms, spam emails, frauds, recommendation algorithms, etc. A lot of treatments have been proposed to enhance models' performance and many different preprocessing or embedding techniques have been used for cleaning data, texts and then turning texts, sentences, words into vectors of real numbers for easier manipulation. For this reason, we are amused by it's essence and would like to do a text classification for ourselves with the aim to see how far we can improve our model accuracy using many different optimization, regularlization techniques and additionally, to see if a stemming method helps improve the test set accuracy.

In this project, we would like to try text classification models on a text data that gives ratings to books on Amazon website. We would like to see how much better or how much worse (in terms of test accuracy) a regularization method or an optimization method can add to our models. Another persepective is that we want to comapare different models in Machine Learning world such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes etc. as well as deep neural network models
